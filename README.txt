"The Hangman" is a popular game in which the user has to guess a hidden word. 
This version has been created by Rito Tartine in C language for the main purpose of learning, thanks to the help of OpenClassRooms and MrXedac. 
Its second purpose is eventually to help testing the Riku Operation System.
